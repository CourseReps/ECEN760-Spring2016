# Programming Assignments

Engineering students possess vastly different programming skills and experience.
This situation can make it difficult for instructors to create activities from which everyone can benefit.
To address this issue, this course offers a set of basic [tasks](../Tasks) to help you get familiar with Python.
It also provides sample code to help students get started; this is available under [Tools](../Tools).
Seasoned programmers are strongly encouraged to help their peers and commit their code on [GitHub](https://github.com/CourseReps/ECEN760-Spring2016).

## Tentative Schedule
 * [Assignment 1](./1assignment.md) due Feb 3.
 * [Assignment 2](./2assignment.md) due Feb 10.
