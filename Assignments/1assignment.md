# Assignment 1


## Handling Graphs

The purpose of this first assignment is to get familiar with handling graphs from a computational perspective.
To be software agnostic, graphs will be specified in text files, each with a simple format.
For students who intend to use [Python](https://www.python.org), sample code is available under [Tools](../Tools).
Using the ```classes``` and ```methods``` provided therein, it is possible to read the text files associated with this assignment into your code.

### Action Items

For each tree, compute the following attributes.

 * __Depth__: Maximum depth of the tree, as seen from the root.
 * __Ancestry__: Number of ancestors for every node.
 * __Graph Radius__: Radius when tree seen as undirected graph.
 * __Nodes per Level__: Number of nodes per level.
 * __Degree Distribution__: Degree distribution from node perspective when tree seen as undirected graph.
