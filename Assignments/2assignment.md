## Graphs and Peeling Algorithms

Fountain codes or rateless codes are a class of codes that can be employed to protect an information message against erasures.
In this paradigm, a source produces and streams a succession of coded packets.
An interested devices can start listening to this stream of information at any point in time.
Once it has acquired enough packets from the source, this device can decode the original message with high probability.
